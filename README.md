Babel : Babel is transpiler which transpiles JSX code to js code or browser understandable code

class component :

State and props:

State : State is an object which holds the information or data of a particular component
State can make dynamic websites
State is private to a component
State is mutable
To access the state in react class components , we need to use this keyword

There are 2 ways to create state in react class based components

1. object way of creation
2. constructor way of creation

To change the state we must use setState method
whenever we are using setState method , component will re-render to show updated layout
state changes are asynchronous

wrong usage of a state
let a = 20
a=30

using state concepts

ex: Youtube button
data : subscribe, subscribed
initialState : subscribe
Event : onClick
finalState: subscribed

Events :
To attach the method in class components , i need to use this.methodName
onClick={this.methodName}
