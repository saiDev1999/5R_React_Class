Conditional rendering in react :

Conditional rendering refers to what we need to show in the UI, based on the condition we will display UI

3 ways for Conditional rendering:

1. if/else
2. ternary operator - condition ? expression1 : expression2
3. logical AND operator (short circuit operator) && (handles only the true case)

exports :
General we use 2 ways to export the funtions/ components /variables

1. Default exports (one component in a file, we can export default)
   while importing the default exports we dont require curly braces

2. Named exports - we can have as many exports in a file
   while importing the named exports we require curly braces

A file can consits of as many exports out of those , we can only export default one time
