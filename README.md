2018 major version -- funtional components for new components

Components :

Components are the independent reusable bits of code which creates part of User interface

Examples of UI :

1. Button
2. Image
3. Heading (h1,...h6)
4. Card
5. Header
6. Footer ...
7. home screen
8. about screen

Components were created in the .js, .jsx, .tsx
js - javascript
jsx - javascript XML

tsx - typescript XML

note : In a file we can create as many components(.js we can many components)

Types of components :

we have 2 types of components in react

1. Funtional based component -> A component designed using plain js functions
2. Class based components -> A component designed using classes in js

Every component must start with the capital letter
Every component can return the markup
Component can be as small as a button or as large as a screen (page)

React is completely a component based approach
will design the component , will reuse the component

Example: I will create button component , i will the button component where ever the button appears

ol - li
ul - li

Ordered list

1. apple
2. banana

Unordered list
apple
banana

Component driven approach : Using this approach , we reuse the markup where ever needed
Nesting of components, we will nest the components to form th final UI
