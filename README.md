controlled components :

steps :

1. Implement the forms in the component using jsx syntax
2. Take the state for the inputs (inividual states or single state)
3. Attach the states to the input tag using value attribute
4. For field validations, we will add onChange attribute for each inputs
   (onChange will accept the function where we can track the input events)
5. Within the function, To collect the values from input we use event.target.value

6. Validate the user,
   if validation fails - Invalid creds
   else validation passes - Valid creds , submit the form

7. We will post the data to the server using post api call

8. if user exists , allow the user (details of user) , invalid creds

Tasks:

1. Repeat the class
2. Show the user name and password in the table , also check user exists in the data base or not
