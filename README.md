JSX :

Every component returns the markup(HTML)

React

JSX :
Javascript and xml , This is the special syntax that react will follow , it looks like a html but its not
This synxtax allows us to write the html inside our javascript file

Using this i can write both html and javascript in a single file
Every component can returns the JSX(HTML+JS)
Only react will allows this type of syntax

Rules of JSX :

1. Every component must return a single parent (which is a shared container) or else we can also use React fragments

2. Every attribute must be in camelCase ex: onClick, onMouseOver, onSubmit

3. html class must be replaced with className

class is a predefined keywoord in react for creating class based components - className

4. Every js code inside the return must written inside the curly braces
